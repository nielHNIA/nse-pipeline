1
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,333
Happy birthday, thank you.

2
00:05:59,583 --> 00:05:59,958
Happy birthday.

3
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,041
Oh, thank you.

4
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:02,250
Happy birthday.

5
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Thank you.

6
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,750
I don't care if every fucking young girl

7
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,875
in this fucking town

8
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,500
in the next few weeks.

9
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,458
Look, I made it simple.

10
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,666
We need her young.

11
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,708
We need her hot.

12
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,375
We need her now.

13
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,708
How the old bitch has been able to stick

14
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:42,916
around for this long.

15
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,625
That's the fucking mystery to me.

16
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,458
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

17
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,833
When was that back in the 30s?

18
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:52,708
What, for King Kong?

19
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,375
No, I don't give a

20
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:00,666
fuck what we promised her.

21
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,708
This is network TV,

22
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,166
not a fucking charity.

23
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,375
Find me somebody new.

24
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Now.

25
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hey, did you know that a woman's

26
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,083
fertility starts to

27
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,791
decrease by the age of 25?

28
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:17,833
How old is Jennifer?

29
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,875
You better get busy.

30
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,458
It's like when you see

31
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:00,041
someone fart on screen.

32
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,958
People just love that.

33
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:10,333
I mean, that's just the way it is.

34
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,791
So you know what I mean?

35
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,291
People are just people.

36
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:17,375
And I have to give people what they want.

37
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,208
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

38
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,208
And people always ask for something new.

39
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,625
Renewal is inevitable.

40
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:33,000
And at 50, well, it stops.

41
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,250
What stops?

42
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,416
What?

43
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,291
What stops?

44
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,583
Um, you know, the um...

45
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,541
The um...

46
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,208
The um...

47
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
Oh, George!

48
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,333
Oh, oh!

49
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:56,708
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

50
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,083
Harvey!

51
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,750
George, those ratings are insane!

52
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,416
You're a genius!

53
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,583
Oh, what a mess. You're a genius.

54
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,166
That's why you'd be drinking.

55
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Oh, that's hilarious.

56
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,958
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,

57
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:01,750
because we have

58
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,166
X-rayed you from head to toe,

59
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,958
and you don't have so

60
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:04,958
much as a crap molar.

61
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,708
So, you are good to go.

62
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,000
Uh, vaccination, okay?

63
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,750
Not going on a vacation.

64
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,456
By the way, I just want to

65
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,083
say, my wife is a huge fan.

66
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,125
Um, blood type...

67
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,125
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

68
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,916
Happy birthday.

69
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,666
Oh, uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry.

70
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,791
I, uh, had to have a...

71
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,208
Bye.

72
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,875
One moment.

73
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,916
It's just one last exam to perform.

74
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,041
I thought he said I was good to go.

75
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is there a problem?

76
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,208
No, it's perfect.

77
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:22,875
You're a good candidate.

78
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,333
I mean, are you good to go?

79
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I wish you the best.

80
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Lizzie?

81
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Lizzie Sparkle?

82
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,333
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

83
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:18,958
Fred!

84
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,750
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

85
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,833
Oh, Fred, of course.

86
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,541
You haven't changed a bit.

87
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,958
You're still the most beautiful girl in

88
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,041
the whole wide world.

89
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,184
You know, I followed your career.

90
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:35,833
What a success.

91
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,583
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

92
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,666
Wow.

93
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,583
Hey, why don't we go out maybe for a

94
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,541
drink sometime now that

95
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,541
we're, you know, reconnected?

96
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:47,625
Um...

97
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,916
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

98
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,750
You're super busy.

99
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:51,291
But you know what?

100
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,708
Why don't you give me your card?

101
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,166
I mean, you never help.

102
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,875
Um, sure, what I...

103
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,458
This will do.

104
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,083
Oh.

105
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't look at my cholesterol levels.

106
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,250
They're a disaster.

107
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,333
Oh, God.

108
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,583
What is that?

109
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,583
There.

110
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,666
Now you've got it.

111
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,458
Have you ever dreamt of a

112
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,000
better version of yourself?

113
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,291
Younger.

114
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,125
More beautiful.

115
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:18,916
More perfect.

116
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:23,375
One single injection unlocks your DNA,

117
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,625
starting a new cellular

118
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:26,958
division that will release

119
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,208
another version of yourself.

120
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,250
This is the substance.

121
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,000
You are the matrix.

122
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,208
Everything comes from you.

123
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,916
And everything is you.

124
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,166
This is simply a

125
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,500
better version of yourself.

126
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,458
You just have to share.

127
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,375
One week for one and

128
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,625
one week for the other.

129
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,833
A perfect balance of seven days each.

130
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:55,958
The one and only thing not to forget.

131
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:59,000
You are one.

132
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,333
You can't escape from yourself.

133
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes.

134
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,791
Hello.

135
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,083
I'd like to order.

136
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Address.

137
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,583
1057 Beverly Canyon.

138
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,083
Write this down.

139
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,916
35 North Byron Alley.

140
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,750
35 North.

141
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:51,000
Phone ringing

142
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,875
You are the matrix.

143
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,041
Everything comes from

144
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,208
you, and everything is you.

145
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,875
This is simply a

146
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,125
better version of yourself.

147
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:14,625
Hello.

148
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:57,583
Thanks.

149
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,791
We'll let you know by next week.

150
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:00,875
Thank you so much.

151
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:02,333
I'm just dying to get the part.

152
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,791
Great dancer.

153
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,458
Hmm, too bad her

154
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,625
boobs aren't in the middle

155
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,000
of her instead of the nose.

156
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:18,583
Next!

157
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,125
Looks like everything sure is in the

158
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,625
right place this time.

159
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,708
Please say your name, age, measurements.

160
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,500
I'm Sue.

161
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,375
I'm Sue.

162
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:07,000
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue,
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

163
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,458
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

164
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,708
Where is she?

165
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:17,833
Where is she?

166
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:35,250
What a gorgeous little angel.

167
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:46,875
You're hired.

168
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:51,958
We want a show that's just like you.

169
00:38:52,458 --> 00:38:53,541
Beautiful and happy.

170
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,500
People want to be happy.

171
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,291
We air in two weeks,

172
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,458
so let's get to work.

173
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,416
I'm gonna let you organize

174
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,750
the rest with my assistant.

175
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,333
Isabella?

176
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,333
Is-is-isis.

177
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,458
Who has time to say that?

178
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,538
We're gonna make you Cindy.

179
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,750
It's shorter, it's better.

180
00:39:17,416 --> 00:39:18,166
So, I'm gonna let you

181
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,750
organize everything else with Cindy.

182
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,083
Oh, um, before you go,

183
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,541
I just have to mention

184
00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:27,166
a small scheduling issue.

185
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:32,125
I have to be out of town every other week

186
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:34,583
to take care of my

187
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,208
mother, who's very sick.

188
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:48,208
I want you for this

189
00:39:48,291 --> 00:39:50,041
show, and we will work around

190
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,083
any mother, brother, fucking sick,

191
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,416
puppy you need to take care of.

192
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Hmm?

193
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,333
Hmm.

194
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:03,458
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

195
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,041
People are gonna love that.

196
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,208
Perfect.

197
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,291
So you jump out, touch your elbows,

198
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,083
head down, contract.

199
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:16,666
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

200
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:53,500
Where have you been?

201
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:55,416
I've all been wanting

202
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,666
to have a drink with you

203
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,750
for your departure.

204
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:02,208
Anyway, we all chipped in

205
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,458
and we got you just a little

206
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,083
something to keep you busy.

207
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,166
It's French.

208
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,458
My wife, she's for her spire.

209
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,541
Oh, I don't want my wife.

210
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,541
Oops, I gotta run.

211
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,500
But it's always great to see you.

212
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,083
The antelope and the deer moving about

213
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:51,500
are going through the text.

214
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,833
The antelope with remotes.

215
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,541
I cannot believe the

216
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,166
incredible price for $49.98.

217
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,083
God dammit, they have the phone

218
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,125
and it's such a great night.

219
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,750
Open up.

220
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,000
We gotta open up.

221
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,750
And uh, sorry.

222
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,288
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

223
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:50,666
She moved out.

224
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:51,958
I'm the new tenant.

225
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,916
Sue.

226
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:56,333
Oliver.

227
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,083
Oliver.

228
00:49:59,625 --> 00:49:59,875
Oliver.

229
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,083
You wanted to complain about something?

230
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,375
Oliver?

231
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,333
What?

232
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,541
No.

233
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

234
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,083
I think it's like

235
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,375
awesome when there's stuff

236
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:12,958
going on in the

237
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,281
building, you know what I mean?

238
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,208
Um, I'm actually,

239
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,916
quite handy if you ever need,

240
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,000
need me to be of aid in any way.

241
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:28,083
I got a sack of tools

242
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,875
and I got a big hammer.

243
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,166
You know what I mean.

244
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,958
Anyways, I live right here,

245
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,708
so you know where to find me.

246
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,833
Anytime.

247
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,708
Day or night.

248
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Later.

249
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,500
Hi everybody.

250
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,583
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.

251
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:47,958
Are you ready?

252
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,166
Let's go.

253
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Thank you so much everybody.

254
00:54:20,916 --> 00:54:21,916
I'll see you next week.

255
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,500
And in the meantime,

256
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,375
take care of yourself.

257
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,458
Courtesy!

258
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,166
Wonderful, wonderful.

259
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,958
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

260
00:56:12,166 --> 00:56:13,166
Don't eat too fast.

261
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:27,083
Are you all right?

262
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:32,875
Yes, I'll be right back.

263
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,125
Are you all right?

264
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:57,750
What did you do?

265
00:59:58,375 --> 00:59:59,208
You've seen me the more

266
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,416
beautiful than before.

267
01:00:40,208 --> 01:00:41,208
No.

268
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:35,916
Yes.

269
01:02:36,458 --> 01:02:37,458
Yes, hi.

270
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:39,708
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

271
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:46,958
I'm 503.

272
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,750
Yes.

273
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,666
Yes, hi.

274
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,375
There's been a slight

275
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:56,583
misuse of the substance.

276
01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:03,041
A few extra hours were accidentally used

277
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,458
causing an alteration.

278
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:09,875
So I'm just looking for

279
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,166
the procedure to reverse it.

280
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,000
What has been used on one

281
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,291
side is lost on the other side.

282
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,833
There's no going back.

283
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,750
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

284
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,458
And obviously she was drunk.

285
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,125
Remember there is no she and you.

286
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,500
You are one.

287
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,000
Respect the balance

288
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,083
and you won't have

289
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,375
any more inconveniences.

290
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,833
Don't you know

291
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,541
Don't you know

292
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,916
You got to pump it up

293
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,250
Don't you know

294
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,875
Don't you know

295
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,333
You got to pump it up

296
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,666
You got to pump it up

297
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,333
You got to pump it up

298
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,500
You got to pump it up

299
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:53,875
You got to pump it up

300
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,291
Sue!

301
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Sue?

302
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,000
I just saw you on TV.

303
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,250
Holy moly.

304
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,708
Makes me want to join your class.

305
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:27,875
Hey, you don't give

306
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,000
private lessons, do you?

307
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,541
Hey, what about a

308
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,666
drink at my place tonight?

309
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:39,958
Come on, don't be shy.

310
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,083
I see you standing behind

311
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,625
the door there, gorgeous.

312
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,458
All right, take your

313
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,416
time, but it's a date.

314
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,250
You know, pump it up

315
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:55,166
You got to pump it up

316
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,166
You know, pump it up

317
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,958
You got to pump it up

318
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,125
Sue.

319
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:24,666
What can I get you?

320
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,000
Moka Latte.

321
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:40,916
It's long, isn't it?

322
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,208
Excuse me?

323
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,333
Seven days.

324
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:21,375
Did you follow me here?

325
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,541
I was just curious to find out

326
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,458
how things were going for you.

327
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,125
Each time you feel a little

328
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:34,500
more lonely, don't you think?

329
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,140
I don't know what you were talking about.

330
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,458
I'm fine.

331
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:43,916
Everything's fine.

332
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,666
It gets harder each time to remember

333
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,458
that you still deserve to exist.

334
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:55,916
That this part of

335
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,375
yourself is still worth something

336
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:03,833
that you still matter.

337
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,500
Has she started yet?

338
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,416
Eating away at you?

339
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:32,666
Fuck!

340
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,291
Watch out!

341
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,250
What?

342
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:55,125
Hey!

343
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:56,916
Move!

344
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,231
You're still the most beautiful girl

345
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,666
in the whole wide world.

346
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Hello?

347
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,250
Hi, Fred.

348
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:44,875
It's Lizzie.

349
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,291
Hello?

350
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,166
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

351
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:52,583
Oh.

352
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:53,958
Wow.

353
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,125
Wow, wow.

354
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,541
I thought I'd never

355
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,726
hear from you again after...

356
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,666
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

357
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:00,791
I just, I've just

358
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,916
been really busy lately.

359
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:07,083
So listen, I was thinking that

360
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:10,208
maybe we could get

361
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,000
together and grab a drink.

362
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Are you still there?

363
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,458
Sorry, I'm in shock.

364
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:22,541
I'm in shock again.

365
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:27,500
I could book Luigi's at eight.

366
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,875
Eight in Luigi's?

367
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:30,458
It is.

368
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,083
I will see you tonight.

369
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:35,916
Bye.

370
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,875
Okay, bye.

371
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,500
Hi everybody.

372
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:44,791
Hi.

373
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,291
Okay, here we go everyone.

374
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,541
Clear the set please.

375
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,041
First positions, thank you.

376
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:50,375
Roll cameras.

377
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:54,166
And in three, two, one.

378
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,875
Squat, squat, squat.

379
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,541
Circle those hips.

380
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:04,583
Circle those hips.

381
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,500
Contract, contract, contract,

382
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,208
contract, contract, contract.

383
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:12,291
Contract, between your legs.

384
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,875
Cut.

385
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,916
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

386
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,166
I just got distracted.

387
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,166
Not a problem, let's

388
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,250
get right back to it.

389
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,500
Back to one please.

390
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,041
Sorry, it's the control room now.

391
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,601
The director said he saw something

392
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,708
bizarre on the monitor.

393
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,360
Bring up the replay on camera two.

394
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:44,666
Camera two.

395
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:56,875
Forward.

396
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,245
Can I have my dressing gown?

397
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,416
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

398
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
But I go and get it.

399
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,981
Let's just take this frame by frame.

400
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,625
I need five minutes.

401
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:23,791
Yes.

402
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,375
This balance is not working.

403
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,041
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

404
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,000
while she wastes seven days

405
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,646
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

406
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,916
Remember there is no she and you.

407
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,166
I love everybody.

408
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:45,708
What's happening?

409
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:46,916
Where is everybody?

410
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,125
The TV's been canceled.

411
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,458
What, why?

412
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,541
Sue.

413
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:52,875
Harvey wants to see you

414
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:53,998
in his office immediately.

415
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,250
Okay.

416
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:57,500
I'll go change him.

417
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:58,708
No, he said now.

418
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:17,996
I'll get right to the bond.

419
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,083
We can't keep you on the morning show.

420
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:23,375
But why?

421
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:24,791
I just started.

422
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,583
Ratings are through the roof.

423
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,333
We started at 42.

424
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,666
Now we're up to like...

425
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:34,833
216.

426
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,208
It's phenomenal.

427
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:39,916
People love you.

428
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,791
They adore you.

429
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,958
They want more and more and more of you.

430
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:46,458
That is why we have

431
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,583
decided that we want you

432
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:52,708
to host the New Year's Eve show.

433
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:54,958
You mean the...

434
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,583
The network's biggest show.

435
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,916
50 million viewers live.

436
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,416
You can't go higher than that.

437
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:04,583
That's gonna be intense.

438
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:09,833
We only have a few more. So are you in?

439
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:22,000
If you don't open the

440
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,333
door and opportunity knocks,

441
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,576
you won't get another chance.

442
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,708
You of all people know this.

443
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:41,916
Just one more day and

444
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,118
then I have a whole week off.

445
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,250
We can switch.

446
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,375
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

447
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:06,291
Just one more day, okay?

448
01:23:57,416 --> 01:24:05,416
Yes. She didn't respect the balance.

449
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,583
She's stealing more

450
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,916
and more time from me,

451
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,875
completely without

452
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,541
consideration of the consequences.

453
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,541
She's a selfish bitch.

454
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:27,875
Would you like to stop?

455
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:31,250
Stop.

456
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:32,875
You are the Matrix.

457
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,875
If you are not satisfied,

458
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,791
you can put an end to the experience

459
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:37,833
and go back to being

460
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:39,458
just you on your own.

461
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,208
Would you like to stop?

462
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,500
Will it go back to the way it was before?

463
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:47,458
What has been

464
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,000
transferred won't come back,

465
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,708
but you can stop the experience.

466
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,750
As of now, would you like to stop?

467
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:55,791
To go back to being just you on your own?

468
01:24:58,916 --> 01:24:59,916
No.

469
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,000
No, no, no.

470
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:04,875
I can't stop.

471
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,333
She just...

472
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,666
I did it.

473
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,208
I did it.

474
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:12,625
I did it. I did it.

475
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,125
The balance just needs to be respected.

476
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,500
So respected.

477
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,625
Stop it, stop it, stop

478
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,291
it, stop it, stop it.

479
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,666
You are the Matrix.

480
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:38,041
Well,

481
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:40,375
congratulations, you've won $25,000.

482
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500
We're standing on our final chance

483
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:43,875
and it's your second question

484
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,333
in our big question

485
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,458
round and play for $250,000.

486
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:53,458
And you'll have just 45

487
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:55,041
seconds to come up to get

488
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:57,458
the correct answer that you can't...

489
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:55,708
Just a little something to keep you busy.

490
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Fuck.

491
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:25,875
Boss.

492
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,833
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

493
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,666
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

494
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:43,333
Are you ready?

495
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,333
Let's welcome her, Sue.

496
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,666
You popped up nowhere on

497
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,375
our screens like a tornado.

498
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,500
I don't think anybody was

499
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,166
really prepared for this world.

500
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:07,000
It all started with the morning show

501
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,708
and rumor has it that you are

502
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,916
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

503
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,708
Wait, just a moment.

504
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,833
I'm being told that you are going to host

505
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,416
the New Year's Eve show.

506
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,500
Can you confirm this?

507
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:23,208
Yes, that's right.

508
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,750
Yes, that's right.

509
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,000
Oh my God, that is huge news.

510
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,898
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

511
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,666
Where are you from?

512
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,000
How did you get discovered?

513
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:40,541
I want, we want to know everything.

514
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:45,833
Well, I mean, there's

515
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:47,791
really not very much to tell.

516
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,750
I'm just a girl from a

517
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,166
very small town in Indiana.

518
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,310
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

519
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,500
In fact, it's not even a town.

520
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,750
I'm not sure you could

521
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,166
really even call it a village.

522
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,791
It's a farm, perhaps?

523
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,875
But ever since I can remember,

524
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,625
it has always been my

525
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,000
dream to be on screen.

526
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:17,583
This is my dream.

527
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,583
As a child, I used to

528
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:20,083
put on shows for my family.

529
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,708
Mm, your family.

530
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,500
How sweet.

531
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:30,250
So, everyone is aware that

532
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,000
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

533
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,500
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

534
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,125
you turned up the volume,

535
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,208
and you rocked their world.

536
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:42,916
Were you a fan of her show?

537
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:52,791
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

538
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,291
I can't really say that I

539
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,958
actually watched her show.

540
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,041
You do know that we're not exactly from

541
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,125
the same generation.

542
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:05,083
And you have to admit, it

543
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,333
was a bit old-fashioned.

544
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:10,833
Jurassic Fitness, really.

545
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,291
Jurassic Fitness, it needed a change.

546
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:18,083
I'll fucking show you.

547
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,166
You really wanna see

548
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,375
some Jurassic Fitness?

549
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:25,708
You want it?

550
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:28,166
Come on, come get your

551
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,000
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

552
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,375
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

553
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,916
So, every morning, rain or shine,

554
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,916
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

555
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:51,791
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

556
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,000
Whether I liked it or not.

557
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,517
I guess that's why you could say

558
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,000
we have some sort of connection.

559
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,666
Some sort of connection.

560
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,833
You wouldn't exist without me.

561
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,118
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

562
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,791
It is time, ladies and

563
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:18,250
gentlemen, for our final question.

564
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,833
The question that we ask each

565
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:24,083
and every one of our guests.

566
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,291
Okay.

567
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,666
Would you share one of your

568
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,958
little beauty secrets with us?

569
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,075
Just one little trick of yours

570
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,125
that helps you look

571
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:36,083
so incredibly stunning.

572
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:36,916
I mean, look at you.

573
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,125
I don't know.

574
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,375
Say it!

575
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:40,958
Say it!

576
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,750
Let me think.

577
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:43,583
Say it!

578
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,208
Tell them who your

579
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,791
little beauty secret is!

580
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:48,041
I guess, I would just

581
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,291
show them right here.

582
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:50,958
Here's your little beauty secret.

583
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:52,958
I guess I just try to be myself.

584
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,541
To be sincere and

585
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,541
grateful for all that I have.

586
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,041
And to always remember

587
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,208
to leave with my heart.

588
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,416
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

589
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:15,500
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

590
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:19,291
Stop it!

591
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:21,125
Stop it.

592
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:22,708
You're taking it from me.

593
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,750
That's your little secret.

594
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,541
Stop it!

595
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,500
You have to control yourself!

596
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,166
I can't go back, I forgot.

597
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:14,416
Oh, shit.

598
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:18,333
Gross old rat.

599
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:20,375
Stop it!

600
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,208
Coming to bed?

601
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,125
Yes, I'll be right there.

602
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:51,708
Yes.

603
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,625
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

604
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:56,125
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

605
01:35:58,833 --> 01:35:59,833
Hello?

606
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,291
It's fucking 503.

607
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,166
Yes.

608
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,708
Fuck!

609
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:06,196
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

610
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:07,611
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

611
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,125
It means you've reached the end.

612
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:13,125
What do you mean the end?

613
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,375
You've drained it all out.

614
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,375
If you want more, you must

615
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:17,541
let the fluid regenerate.

616
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,000
Tell me how to do it.

617
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,291
I need to stabilize myself right now.

618
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:23,958
You simply have to switch.

619
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,458
Excuse me?

620
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,833
The switch reboots the

621
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,125
fluid secretion process

622
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,458
so you can continue to

623
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,541
enjoy the experience.

624
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,625
No, no, no, no, no.

625
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,583
I can't switch, I can't.

626
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:39,333
Especially not now.

627
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,000
There is no other option.

628
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,333
Sue?

629
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,625
Babe?

630
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:26,833
Sue?

631
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,458
You all right?

632
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,166
Should I start out tomorrow?

633
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:42,250
Babe?

634
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,875
Babe?

635
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,375
Sue?

636
01:37:57,416 --> 01:37:58,416
Is something wrong?

637
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:03,875
You look cranky because

638
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:04,958
you're related business.

639
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:11,125
Sue, open the door.

640
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,291
Come on, Sue.

641
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:15,855
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.

642
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:18,541
Sue, open the door.

643
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,208
Open the door, Sue, come on.

644
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:41,291
Come on.

645
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:52,625
Guys!

646
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,500
What the fuck?

647
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,250
The fuck out!

648
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,875
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

649
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,250
Leave me alone!

650
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:11,500
What the fuck?

651
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:59,708
Doorbell

652
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,500
Yes?

653
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,208
It's 503.

654
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,416
I want to stop.

655
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,708
Are you sure? Once you

656
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,125
stop, you can't go back.

657
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,458
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

658
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:22,958
I want to stop!

659
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,208
We'll deliver.

660
01:40:51,166 --> 01:40:58,916
Panting

661
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Speaking in foreign language

662
01:42:35,333 --> 01:42:36,333
Are you sure?

663
01:42:38,666 --> 01:42:40,500
Once you stop, you can't go back.

664
01:42:41,375 --> 01:42:43,458
You will simply remain on your own.

665
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:46,500
Just on your own.

666
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,750
Just on your own.

667
01:42:52,500 --> 01:43:00,500
Shut the fuck up! Breathing heavily

668
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,500
Okay.

669
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:01,250
I can't do this.

670
01:44:03,708 --> 01:44:06,166
I need you.

671
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,583
I need myself.

672
01:44:11,833 --> 01:44:18,791
You gotta get ready. It's our big night.

673
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:22,291
Come on. They're gonna love you so much.

674
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Come on.

675
01:44:25,791 --> 01:44:26,791
Come on.

676
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:29,833
You're the only lovable part

677
01:44:29,916 --> 01:44:31,666
of me. You have to come back.

678
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:34,125
You have to come back. Come back.

679
01:44:41,166 --> 01:44:49,166
Panting

680
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,000
Okay. Okay.

681
01:44:55,291 --> 01:44:56,291
Come on.

682
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,708
Come on.

683
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:09,791
Come on.

684
01:46:53,208 --> 01:46:54,791
Minimumy revenues

685
01:46:54,875 --> 01:46:59,958
rolls dice

686
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:56,250
Oh, don't!

687
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:13,892
You guys know what happened, makeup?

688
01:51:13,916 --> 01:51:15,516
Here, we gotta get you the pinning room.

689
01:51:16,541 --> 01:51:18,000
We have one final test on

690
01:51:18,083 --> 01:51:19,166
stage, lighting a sound.

691
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:20,642
We have it in, I'll type it for the show.

692
01:51:20,666 --> 01:51:21,166
You got it?

693
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:21,958
You good?

694
01:51:22,291 --> 01:51:23,291
Okay, let's go.

695
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,500
Grab it.

696
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:33,791
One more.

697
01:51:43,875 --> 01:51:44,875
There you go.

698
01:51:52,583 --> 01:51:53,583
You good?

699
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:55,166
You gonna dance, lads?

700
01:52:00,208 --> 01:52:01,750
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

701
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:30,041
They need to see you on

702
01:53:30,125 --> 01:53:31,165
stage with the satellites.

703
01:53:55,625 --> 01:53:56,833
Have you ever dreamt

704
01:53:58,291 --> 01:53:59,750
of a better version of yourself?

705
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:04,166
More beautiful, more perfect.

706
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Tim?

707
01:54:07,833 --> 01:54:09,208
Yes, let me meet you there.

708
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:11,190
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

709
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:29,250
Sue?

710
01:54:32,666 --> 01:54:34,708
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

711
01:54:35,041 --> 01:54:37,708
They have been dying to meet you.

712
01:54:39,666 --> 01:54:44,875
Is everything okay?

713
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,500
So smile.

714
01:54:59,416 --> 01:55:01,500
That's what we want tonight.

715
01:55:02,500 --> 01:55:06,083
Pretty girls should always smile.

716
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,666
Bathers, blathers, blathers.

717
01:56:14,666 --> 01:56:15,875
Hey, you ready for tonight?

718
01:57:05,833 --> 01:57:06,208
Would you be the

719
01:57:06,291 --> 01:57:07,291
better version of myself?

720
01:57:07,583 --> 01:57:08,583
Please give me a better

721
01:57:08,666 --> 01:57:10,166
version of myself, please.

722
01:57:16,750 --> 01:57:17,750
Please.

723
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:20,666
Come on.

724
01:58:01,625 --> 01:58:04,291
Jesus.

725
01:59:15,625 --> 01:59:17,791
Looks like everything sure is in the

726
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:19,250
right place this time.

727
01:59:21,416 --> 01:59:23,500
Please say your name, age, measurements.

728
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:24,416
Pretty girls should always smile.

729
02:02:59,791 --> 02:03:01,208
At last, we're starting to worry.

730
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:02,495
Hurry up, you're up in five.

731
02:03:21,791 --> 02:03:23,541
There she is, so beautiful.

732
02:03:25,250 --> 02:03:26,250
We love you.

733
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,333
This is where you belong.

734
02:03:29,875 --> 02:03:31,125
You always belong here.

735
02:03:31,208 --> 02:03:32,500
We can't do it without you.

736
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,750
We'll never do it without you.

737
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:36,666
Who would you replace them all?

738
02:03:36,916 --> 02:03:37,916
Oh.

739
02:04:05,166 --> 02:04:06,166
Girls, come on, let's go.

740
02:04:06,208 --> 02:04:07,351
Let's go, what are we waiting for?

741
02:04:07,375 --> 02:04:08,375
Okay, come on, everybody,

742
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:09,875
let's go, let's go, let's go.

743
02:04:13,541 --> 02:04:15,625
You will not be disappointed.

744
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,666
She's my most beautiful creation.

745
02:04:18,916 --> 02:04:20,583
I have shaped her for success.

746
02:04:26,875 --> 02:04:32,791
Five, four, three, two, one.

747
02:07:28,333 --> 02:07:29,333
The monster!

748
02:07:38,125 --> 02:07:39,125
Shoot the monster!

749
02:07:40,791 --> 02:07:41,791
It's a freak!

750
02:07:42,750 --> 02:07:43,791
The monster!

751
02:07:46,416 --> 02:07:47,416
Don't be a bird.

752
02:07:47,583 --> 02:07:48,125
Monster!

753
02:07:48,500 --> 02:07:49,958
You're stupid.

754
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,500
It's real.

755
02:07:52,375 --> 02:07:55,125
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit.

756
02:08:00,416 --> 02:08:01,416
Freak!

757
02:08:13,958 --> 02:08:16,958
Freak, monster, monster!

758
02:08:21,583 --> 02:08:22,583
It's me.

759
02:08:24,958 --> 02:08:25,958
It's me.

760
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:36,875
I'm just kidding.

761
02:09:31,791 --> 02:09:32,916
Too bad her boobs aren't

762
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:34,000
in the middle of her face

763
02:09:34,125 --> 02:09:35,333
instead of that nose.

764
02:09:37,416 --> 02:09:38,416
Hmm.

765
02:09:39,375 --> 02:09:40,375
Next!

766
02:09:46,083 --> 02:09:48,916
Pretty girls should always smile.

767
02:09:54,666 --> 02:09:55,666
I have 50.

768
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:57,291
It stops.

769
02:12:58,333 --> 02:12:59,333
I love you.

770
02:12:59,708 --> 02:13:01,500
I love you.

771
02:13:04,916 --> 02:13:06,208
You're a place of all.
