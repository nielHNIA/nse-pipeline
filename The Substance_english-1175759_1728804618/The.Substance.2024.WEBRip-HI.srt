366
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,291
So you jump out, touch your elbows,

367
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,083
head down, contract.

368
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:16,666
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

Where have you been?

394
00:44:54,791 --> 00:44:55,416
I've all been wanting

395
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,666
to have a drink with you

396
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:57,750
for your departure.

397
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:02,208
Anyway, we all chipped in

398
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,458
and we got you just a little

399
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,083
something to keep you busy.

400
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:09,166
It's French.

401
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,458
My wife, she's for her spire.

402
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:12,541
Oh, I don't want my wife.

403
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,541
Oops, I gotta run.

404
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,500
But it's always great to see you.

405

The antelope with remotes.

420
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:47,541
I cannot believe the

421
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,166
incredible price for $49.98.

God dammit, they have the phone

434
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,125
and it's such a great night.

435
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,750
Open up.

436
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:43,000
We gotta open up.

437
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,750
And uh, sorry.

438
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:49,288
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

439
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:50,666
She moved out.

440
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:51,958
I'm the new tenant.

441
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:54,916
Sue.

442
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:56,333
Oliver.

443
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,083
Oliver.

444
00:49:59,625 --> 00:49:59,875
Oliver.

445
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:02,083
You wanted to complain about something?

446
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,375
Oliver?

447
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,333
What?

448
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,541
No.

449
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

450
00:50:10,166 --> 00:50:11,083
I think it's like

451
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:12,375
awesome when there's stuff

452
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:12,958
going on in the

453
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,281

454
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,208
Um, I'm actually,

455
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:21,916
quite handy if you ever need,

456
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:26,000
need me to be of aid in any way.

457
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:28,083
I got a sack of tools

458
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:30,875
and I got a big hammer.

459
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:35,166
You know what I mean.

460
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,958
(laughing) Anyways, I live right here,

461
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,708
so you know where to find me.

462
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:42,833
Anytime.

463
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:44,708
Day or night.

464
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Later.

Don't eat too fast.

01:02:57,333 --> 01:03:03,041
A few extra hours were accidentally used

531
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,458
causing an alteration.

532
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:09,875
So I'm just looking for

533
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,166
the procedure to reverse it.

534
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,000
What has been used on one

535
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,291
side is lost on the other side.

536
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:16,833
There's no going back.

537
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,750
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

538
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:29,458
And obviously she was drunk.

539
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:32,125
Remember there is no she and you.

540
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:33,500
You are one.

541
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:35,000
Respect the balance

542
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,083
and you won't have

543
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,375
any more inconveniences.

544
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,333
(phone beeping)

545
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:45,000
(engine revving)

546
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:13,375
(dramatic music)

547
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,833
Don't you know

548
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:21,541
Don't you know

549
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,916
You got to pump it up

550
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,250
Don't you know

551
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:28,875
Don't you know

552
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,333
You got to pump it up

553
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:33,666
You got to pump it up

554
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,333
You got to pump it up

555
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:47,500
You got to pump it up

556
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:53,875
You got to pump it up

557
01:04:53,958 --> 01:05:01,958
(engine revving) (dramatic music)

558
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:13,833
(bell ringing)

559
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,291
Sue!

560
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Sue?

561
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,000
I just saw you on TV.

562
01:05:22,125 --> 01:05:23,250
Holy moly.

563
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,708
Makes me want to join your class.

564
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:27,875
Hey, you don't give

565
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:29,000
private lessons, do you?

566
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:31,208
(laughing)

567
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,541
Hey, what about a

568
01:05:34,625 --> 01:05:36,666
drink at my place tonight?

569
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:39,958
Come on, don't be shy.

570
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,083
I see you standing behind

571
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:43,625
the door there, gorgeous.

572
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,458
All right, take your

573
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,416
time, but it's a date.

574
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,250
You know, pump it up

575
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:55,166
You got to pump it up

576
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,166
You know, pump it up

577
01:05:57,583 --> 01:05:58,958
You got to pump it up

578
01:06:00,125 --> 01:06:04,750
(engine revving)

579
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:10,125
(dramatic music)

580
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:35,291
(dramatic music)

581
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:37,041
(gasping)

582
01:06:37,125 --> 01:06:38,125
Sue.

583
01:06:38,916 --> 01:06:44,958
(dramatic music)

584
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:46,291
(gasping)

585
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:09,666
(dramatic music)

586
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:24,416
What can I get you?

587
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:27,083
(dramatic music)

588
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:30,000
Moka Latte.

589
01:07:39,041 --> 01:07:40,916
It's long, isn't it?

590
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,208
Excuse me?

591
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:49,333
Seven days.

592
01:07:54,666 --> 01:08:02,666
(dramatic music)

593
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:21,375
Did you follow me here?

594
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,541
I was just curious to find out

595
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,458
how things were going for you.

596
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,125
Each time you feel a little

597
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:34,500
more lonely, don't you think?

598
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,140
I don't know what you were talking about.

599
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:41,458
I'm fine.

600
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:43,916
Everything's fine.

601
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:47,666
It gets harder each time to remember

602
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:51,458
that you still deserve to exist.

603
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,125
(dramatic music)

604
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:55,916
That this part of

605
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,375
yourself is still worth something

606
01:08:59,458 --> 01:09:03,833
that you still matter.

607
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,500
Has she started yet?

608
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,416
Eating away at you?

609
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,125
(dramatic music)

610
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,166
(gasping)

611
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:32,666
Fuck!

612
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,291
Watch out!

613
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,250
What?

614
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:47,041
(dramatic music)

615
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,708
(engine revving)

616
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:55,125
Hey!

617
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:56,916
Move!

618
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,458
(engine revving)

619
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,833
(dramatic music)

620
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,231
You're still the most beautiful girl

621
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:30,666
in the whole wide world.

622
01:10:33,291 --> 01:10:39,791
(phone ringing)

623
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Hello?

624
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,250
Hi, Fred.

625
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:44,875
It's Lizzie.

626
01:10:48,291 --> 01:10:49,291
Hello?

627
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,166
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

628
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:52,583
Oh.

629
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:53,958
Wow.

630
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,125
Wow, wow.

631
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,541
I thought I'd never

632
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,705
hear from you again after...

633
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:59,666
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

634
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:00,791
I just, I've just

635
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,916
been really busy lately.

636
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:07,083
So listen, I was thinking that

637
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:10,208
maybe we could get

638
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,000
together and grab a drink.

639
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Are you still there?

640
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,458
Sorry, I'm in shock.

641
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:22,541
I'm in shock again.

642
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:27,500
I could book Luigi's at eight.

643
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,875
Eight in Luigi's?

644
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:30,458
It is.

645
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:34,083
I will see you tonight.

646
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:35,916
Bye.

647
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:37,875
Okay, bye.

648
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,791
(sighing)

649
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:44,333

01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:48,250

(door opening)

679
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:43,500
Hi everybody.

680
01:16:43,791 --> 01:16:44,791
Hi.

681
01:16:45,083 --> 01:16:46,291
Okay, here we go everyone.

682
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,541
Clear the set please.

683
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,041
First positions, thank you.

684
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:50,375
Roll cameras.

685
01:16:50,875 --> 01:16:54,166
(beeping) And in three, two, one.

686
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:57,750
(electronic music)

687
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,875
Squat, squat, squat.

688
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:02,861
(upbeat music) Circle those hips.

689
01:17:03,583 --> 01:17:04,903
(upbeat music) Circle those hips.

690
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:07,500
(upbeat music) Contract,
contract, contract,

691
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,208
contract, contract, contract.

692
01:17:10,291 --> 01:17:10,500
(upbeat music)

693
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:12,291
Contract, between your legs.

694
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,041
(upbeat music)

695
01:17:18,875 --> 01:17:19,875
Cut.

696
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:21,458
(beeping)

697
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:27,916
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

698
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,166
I just got distracted.

699
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,166
Not a problem, let's

700
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,250
get right back to it.

701
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,500
Back to one please.

702
01:17:37,708 --> 01:17:39,041
Sorry, it's the control room now.

703
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:40,601
The director said he saw something

704
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:41,708
bizarre on the monitor.

705
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,360
Bring up the replay on camera two.

706
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:44,666
Camera two.

707
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:53,666
(ominous music)

708
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:56,875
Forward.

709
01:17:58,583 --> 01:17:59,666
(electronic beeping)

710
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:04,245
Can I have my dressing gown?

711
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,416
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

712
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
But I go and get it.

713
01:18:07,541 --> 01:18:08,981
Let's just take this frame by frame.

714
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:15,833
(electronic beeping)

715
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,625
I need five minutes.

716
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,333
(electronic beeping)

717
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:42,291
(electronic beeping)

718
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:17,208
(electronic beeping)

719
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:27,333
(electronic beeping)

720
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:32,833
(screaming)

721
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:45,166
(panting)

722
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:50,375
(ominous music)

723
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:12,416
(electronic beeping)

724
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:23,791
Yes.

725
01:20:23,875 --> 01:20:25,375
This balance is not working.

726
01:20:25,958 --> 01:20:28,041
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

727
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:31,000
while she wastes seven days

728
01:20:31,166 --> 01:20:32,646
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

729
01:20:32,958 --> 01:20:34,916
Remember there is no she and you.

730
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:35,583
(electronic beeping)

731
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:36,666
(screaming)

732
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,166
I love everybody.

733
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:45,708
What's happening?

734
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:46,916
Where is everybody?

735
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:48,125
The TV's been canceled.

736
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,458
What, why?

737
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:51,541
Sue.

738
01:20:52,208 --> 01:20:52,875
Harvey wants to see you

739
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:53,998
in his office immediately.

740
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,250
Okay.

741
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:57,500
I'll go change him.

742
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:58,708
No, he said now.

743
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:02,125
(ominous music)

744
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:14,625
(electronic beeping)

745
01:21:16,916 --> 01:21:17,996
I'll get right to the bond.

746
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,083
We can't keep you on the morning show.

747
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:23,375
But why?

748
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:24,791
I just started.

749
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:27,583
Ratings are through the roof.

750
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,333
We started at 42.

751
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:32,666
Now we're up to like...

752
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:34,833
216.

753
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:36,208
It's phenomenal.

754
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:39,916
People love you.

755
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,791
They adore you.

756
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,958
They want more and more and more of you.

757
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:46,458
That is why we have

758
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,583
decided that we want you

759
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:52,708
to host the New Year's Eve show.

760
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:54,958
You mean the...

761
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,583
The network's biggest show.

762
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,916
50 million viewers live.

763
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:01,416
You can't go higher than that.

764
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:03,833
(laughing)

765
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:04,583
That's gonna be intense.

766
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:09,833
We only have a few more. So are you in?

767
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:15,250
(ominous music)

768
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:19,708
(door creaking)

769
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:22,000
If you don't open the

770
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:23,333
door and opportunity knocks,

771
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:24,576
you won't get another chance.

772
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:27,708
You of all people know this.

773
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:31,458
(ominous music)

774
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:37,166
(door creaking)

775
01:22:40,916 --> 01:22:41,916
Just one more day and

776
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,118
then I have a whole week off.

777
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:44,250
We can switch.

778
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:55,125
(ominous music)

779
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,375
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

780
01:23:05,291 --> 01:23:06,291
Just one more day, okay?

781
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:14,625
(ominous music)

782
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:19,625
(sighing)

783
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:40,583
(ominous music)

784
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:42,041
(gasping)

785
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:45,083
(screaming)

786
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:47,500
(ominous music)

787
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:56,000
(ominous music)

788
01:23:57,416 --> 01:24:05,416
Yes. She didn't respect the balance.

789
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,583
She's stealing more

790
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:20,916
and more time from me,

791
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,875
completely without

792
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,541
consideration of the consequences.

793
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,541
She's a selfish bitch.

794
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:27,875
Would you like to stop?

795
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:31,250
Stop.

796
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:32,875
You are the Matrix.

797
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,875
If you are not satisfied,

798
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,791
you can put an end to the experience

799
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:37,833
and go back to being

800
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:39,458
just you on your own.

801
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:41,208
Would you like to stop?

802
01:24:44,375 --> 01:24:46,500
Will it go back to the way it was before?

803
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:47,458
What has been

804
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,000
transferred won't come back,

805
01:24:49,208 --> 01:24:50,708
but you can stop the experience.

806
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,750
As of now, would you like to stop?

807
01:24:53,166 --> 01:24:55,791
To go back to being just you on your own?

808
01:24:58,916 --> 01:24:59,916
No.

809
01:25:01,958 --> 01:25:03,000
No, no, no.

810
01:25:03,875 --> 01:25:04,875
I can't stop.

811
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:07,333
She just...

812
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:08,666
I did it.

813
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:10,208
I did it.

814
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:12,625
I did it. I did it. (door slams)

815
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,125
The balance just needs to be respected.

816
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,500
So respected.

817
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:21,375
(phone beeps)

818
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:24,625
Stop it, stop it, stop

819
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:26,291
it, stop it, stop it.

820
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:32,333
(ominous music)

821
01:25:35,666 --> 01:25:36,666
You are the Matrix.

822
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:38,041
Well,

823
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:40,375
congratulations, you've won $25,000.

824
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,500
We're standing on our final chance

825
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:43,875
and it's your second question

826
01:25:43,958 --> 01:25:45,333
in our big question

827
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,458
round and play for $250,000.

828
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,708
(audience cheers)

829
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:53,458
And you'll have just 45

830
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:55,041
seconds to come up to get

831
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:57,458
the correct answer that you can't...

832
01:25:57,541 --> 01:25:58,541
(woman gasps)

833
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:08,875
(woman gasps)

834
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,541
(woman groans)

835
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:15,500
(woman groans)

836
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:17,250
(woman gasps)

837
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:35,166
(woman groans)

838
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:38,958
(woman screams)

839
01:26:50,125 --> 01:26:55,708
Just a little something to keep you busy.

840
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:08,916
(door slams)

841
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Fuck.

842
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:25,875
Boss.

843
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:35,291
(ominous music)

844
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,833
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

845
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:42,666
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

846
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:43,333
Are you ready?

847
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,333
Let's welcome her, Sue.

848
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:47,333
(audience cheers)

849
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,666
You popped up nowhere on

850
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,375
our screens like a tornado.

851
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:54,500
I don't think anybody was

852
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:56,166
really prepared for this world.

853
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,666
(audience cheers)

854
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:02,125
(thunder rumbles)

855
01:28:02,208 --> 01:28:03,708
(audience cheers)

856
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:07,000
It all started with the morning show

857
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:09,708
and rumor has it that you are

858
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,916
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

859
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:14,083
(audience cheers)

860
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,708
Wait, just a moment.

861
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:18,833
I'm being told that you are going to host

862
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,416
the New Year's Eve show.

863
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:21,500
Can you confirm this?

864
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:23,208
Yes, that's right.

865
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,750
Yes, that's right.

866
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:26,541
(ominous music)

867
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,000
Oh my God, that is huge news.

868
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:34,898
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

869
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:35,666
Where are you from?

870
01:28:35,916 --> 01:28:37,000
How did you get discovered?

871
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:40,541
I want, we want to know everything.

872
01:28:42,625 --> 01:28:45,833
(ominous music) Well, I mean, there's

873
01:28:45,916 --> 01:28:47,791
really not very much to tell.

874
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,750
I'm just a girl from a

875
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,166
very small town in Indiana.

876
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,310
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

877
01:28:55,625 --> 01:28:57,500
In fact, it's not even a town.

878
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:58,750
I'm not sure you could

879
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,166
really even call it a village.

880
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:02,791
It's a farm, perhaps?

881
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:05,666
(audience laughs)

882
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:08,958
(ominous music)

883
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:11,875
But ever since I can remember,

884
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:13,625
it has always been my

885
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:15,000
dream to be on screen.

886
01:29:15,791 --> 01:29:17,583
This is my dream.

887
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,583
As a child, I used to

888
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:20,083
put on shows for my family.

889
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:21,708
Mm, your family.

890
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,500
How sweet.

891
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,500
(ominous music)

892
01:29:26,291 --> 01:29:30,250
So, everyone is aware that

893
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:33,000
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

894
01:29:34,375 --> 01:29:37,500
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

895
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:39,125
you turned up the volume,

896
01:29:39,333 --> 01:29:41,208
and you rocked their world.

897
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:42,916
Were you a fan of her show?

898
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:52,791
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

899
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,291
I can't really say that I

900
01:29:55,375 --> 01:29:57,958
actually watched her show.

901
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:01,041
You do know that we're not exactly from

902
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,125
the same generation.

903
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:03,291
(audience laughs)

904
01:30:03,416 --> 01:30:05,083
And you have to admit, it

905
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:06,333
was a bit old-fashioned.

906
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:10,833
Jurassic Fitness, really.

907
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:14,575
(audience laughs) Jurassic
Fitness, it needed a change.

908
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:16,500
(ominous music)

909
01:30:16,583 --> 01:30:18,083
I'll fucking show you.

910
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,166
You really wanna see

911
01:30:20,250 --> 01:30:21,375
some Jurassic Fitness?

912
01:30:24,708 --> 01:30:25,708
You want it?

913
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:28,166
Come on, come get your

914
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,000
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

915
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:35,125
(ominous music)

916
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,375
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

917
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,916
So, every morning, rain or shine,

918
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:49,916
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

919
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:51,791
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

920
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:54,000
Whether I liked it or not.

921
01:30:54,791 --> 01:30:54,833
(audience laughs)

922
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,517
I guess that's why you could say

923
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,000
we have some sort of connection.

924
01:30:58,375 --> 01:30:59,666
Some sort of connection.

925
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:02,833
You wouldn't exist without me.

926
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:09,291
(audience applauds)

927
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,118
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

928
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:15,791
It is time, ladies and

929
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:18,250
gentlemen, for our final question.

930
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,833
The question that we ask each

931
01:31:20,916 --> 01:31:24,083
and every one of our guests.

932
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:24,458
Okay.

933
01:31:25,250 --> 01:31:25,291
(laughs)

934
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,666
Would you share one of your

935
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,958
little beauty secrets with us?

936
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:33,075
Just one little trick of yours

937
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:34,125
that helps you look

938
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:36,083
so incredibly stunning.

939
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:36,916
I mean, look at you.

940
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,125
I don't know.

941
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,375
Say it!

942
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:40,958
Say it!

943
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,750
Let me think.

944
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:43,583
Say it!

945
01:31:44,041 --> 01:31:45,208
Tell them who your

946
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:46,791
little beauty secret is!

947
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:48,041
I guess, I would just

948
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,291
show them right here.

949
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:50,958
Here's your little beauty secret.

950
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:52,958
I guess I just try to be myself.

951
01:31:53,375 --> 01:31:54,541
To be sincere and

952
01:31:54,625 --> 01:31:56,541
grateful for all that I have.

953
01:31:57,208 --> 01:31:58,041
And to always remember

954
01:31:58,125 --> 01:31:59,208
to leave with my heart.

955
01:31:59,458 --> 01:32:01,416
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

956
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:03,458
(grunts)

957
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:15,500
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

958
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,583
(laughs)

959
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:19,291
Stop it!

960
01:32:20,125 --> 01:32:21,125
Stop it.

961
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:22,708
You're taking it from me.

962
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,750
That's your little secret.

963
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:26,875
Stop it!

964
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,500
(grunts)

965
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:31,708
(whispers)

966
01:32:41,833 --> 01:32:44,500
You have to control yourself!

967
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:53,833
(growls)

968
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,166
I can't go back, I forgot.

969
01:33:13,416 --> 01:33:14,416
Oh, shit.

970
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:18,333
Gross old rat.

971
01:33:19,375 --> 01:33:20,375
Stop it!

972
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:50,833
(growls)

973
01:33:50,916 --> 01:33:58,916
(upbeat music)

974
01:34:19,708 --> 01:34:26,541
(dramatic music)

975
01:34:34,208 --> 01:34:35,208
Coming to bed?

976
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,125
Yes, I'll be right there.

977
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:58,500
(dramatic music) (dramatic music)

978
01:35:42,541 --> 01:35:48,708
(phone rings)

979
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:51,708
Yes.

980
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,625
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

981
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:56,125
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

982
01:35:58,833 --> 01:35:59,833
Hello?

983
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:02,291
It's fucking 503.

984
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:03,166
Yes.

985
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:04,708
Fuck!

986
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:06,196
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

987
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:07,611
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

988
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,125
It means you've reached the end.

989
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:10,875
(dramatic music)

990
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:13,125
What do you mean the end?

991
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,375
You've drained it all out.

992
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:16,375
If you want more, you must

993
01:36:16,458 --> 01:36:17,541
let the fluid regenerate.

994
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,000
Tell me how to do it.

995
01:36:20,083 --> 01:36:22,291
I need to stabilize myself right now.

996
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:23,958
You simply have to switch.

997
01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,458
Excuse me?

998
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,833
The switch reboots the

999
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,125
fluid secretion process

1000
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,458
so you can continue to

1001
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,541
enjoy the experience.

1002
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,625
No, no, no, no, no.

1003
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,583
I can't switch, I can't.

1004
01:36:38,625 --> 01:36:39,333
Especially not now.

1005
01:36:39,625 --> 01:36:41,000
There is no other option.

1006
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:49,166
(woman screams)

1007
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:55,041
(woman groans)

1008
01:36:55,125 --> 01:36:59,666
(woman groans)

1009
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:00,750
(dramatic music)

1010
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:09,333
Sue?

1011
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:22,625
Babe?

1012
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:26,833
Sue?

1013
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,458
You all right?

1014
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,166
Should I start out tomorrow?

1015
01:37:38,166 --> 01:37:41,166
(woman groans)

1016
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:42,250
Babe?

1017
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,875
Babe?

1018
01:37:55,375 --> 01:37:56,375
Sue?

1019
01:37:57,416 --> 01:37:58,416
Is something wrong?

1020
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:03,875
You look cranky because

1021
01:38:03,958 --> 01:38:04,958
you're related business.

1022
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,041
(dramatic music)

1023
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:11,125
Sue, open the door.

1024
01:38:11,875 --> 01:38:13,291
Come on, Sue.

1025
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:15,855
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.

1026
01:38:17,541 --> 01:38:18,541
Sue, open the door.

1027
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,208
Open the door, Sue, come on.

1028
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:31,500
(dramatic music) (woman gasps)

1029
01:38:40,208 --> 01:38:40,250
(dramatic music)

1030
01:38:40,291 --> 01:38:41,291
Come on.

1031
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:51,541
(woman screams)

1032
01:38:51,625 --> 01:38:52,625
Guys!

1033
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,500
What the fuck?

1034
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,250
The fuck out!

1035
01:38:57,708 --> 01:38:59,875
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

1036
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,250
Leave me alone!

1037
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:11,500
What the fuck?

1038
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:59,708
Doorbell

1039
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,500
Yes?

1040
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,208
It's 503.

1041
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:13,416
I want to stop.

1042
01:40:13,958 --> 01:40:15,708
Are you sure? Once you

1043
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:17,125
stop, you can't go back.

1044
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:20,458
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

1045
01:40:20,541 --> 01:40:22,958
I want to stop!

1046
01:40:24,208 --> 01:40:25,208
We'll deliver.

1047
01:40:51,166 --> 01:40:58,916
Panting

1048
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Speaking in foreign language

1049
01:41:20,541 --> 01:41:22,500
Screaming

1050
01:41:50,791 --> 01:41:52,500
